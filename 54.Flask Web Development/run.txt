Starting a Flask project in VS Code involves a few setup steps. Here's a straightforward guide to get you started from scratch:

---

## âœ… 1. **Install Prerequisites**

Make sure you have these installed:

* **Python (3.x)** â€“ download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/)
* **VS Code** â€“ download from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* **Python extension** for VS Code â€“ install via Extensions tab (`ms-python.python`)

---

## âœ… 2. **Create Project Folder**

Create and open a new project directory in VS Code:

```bash
mkdir my_flask_app
cd my_flask_app
code .
```

---

## âœ… 3. **Set Up Virtual Environment**

In VS Code terminal:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Then activate it:

* **Windows:**

  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
* **Mac/Linux:**

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

---

## âœ… 4. **Install Flask**

With the virtual environment activated:

```bash
pip install flask
```

Optionally freeze dependencies:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

---

## âœ… 5. **Create a Basic Flask App**

Create a file `app.py` in your project folder:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello, Flask!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

---

## âœ… 6. **Set Environment Variables**

In the terminal, set the `FLASK_APP` environment variable:

* **Windows (cmd):**

  ```cmd
  set FLASK_APP=app.py
  set FLASK_ENV=development
  ```
* **PowerShell:**

  ```powershell
  $env:FLASK_APP = "app.py"
  $env:FLASK_ENV = "development"
  ```
* **Mac/Linux:**

  ```bash
  export FLASK_APP=app.py
  export FLASK_ENV=development
  ```

---

## âœ… 7. **Run the Flask App**

```bash
flask run
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser.

---

## âœ… 8. **Optional: Configure `launch.json` for VS Code Debugging**

1. Go to **Run & Debug** (Ctrl+Shift+D)
2. Click **"create a launch.json file"**
3. Choose **Python**
4. Replace contents with:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Python: Flask",
      "type": "python",
      "request": "launch",
      "module": "flask",
      "env": {
        "FLASK_APP": "app.py",
        "FLASK_ENV": "development"
      },
      "args": [
        "run"
      ],
      "jinja": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Now press F5 to launch and debug.

---

## âœ… 9. **Organize Project (Optional but Recommended)**

As your app grows, structure it like this:

```
my_flask_app/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routes.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ venv/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

Let me know if you want a full project scaffold or REST API setup.


The error:

> `'flask' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.`

means that the `flask` command-line tool is **not available in your system PATH**, likely because:

1. The virtual environment isnâ€™t activated correctly, **or**
2. Flask isn't installed inside the virtual environment, **or**
3. You're using the **wrong terminal** (e.g., not using the terminal integrated with VS Code where the virtual environment is activated).

---

### âœ… Try These Steps to Fix It:

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 1: **Activate Virtual Environment**

Make sure you're in the project folder and the virtual environment is activated:

**For CMD:**

```cmd
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**For PowerShell:**

```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

After this, your terminal should show something like:

```powershell
(venv) C:\Users\CALVIN\...
```

If it already shows `(venv)` â€” skip to Step 2.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 2: **Ensure Flask is Installed**

Check if Flask is installed in the virtual environment:

```bash
pip show flask
```

If nothing is shown, install it:

```bash
pip install flask
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 3: **Use the Correct Terminal**

**Important:** If you opened another terminal (e.g., outside of VS Code), it might not be using the activated environment.

Always use the **integrated terminal in VS Code**:

* Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>\`</kbd> (backtick) to open it.
* Make sure `(venv)` is showing.
* Run:

```bash
flask run
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 4: **Use Python to Run Flask (as a workaround)**

If `flask` still isn't recognized, try running Flask via Python:

```bash
python -m flask run
```

This works even if the `flask` CLI command isn't directly available.

---

### âœ… If You Still Have Problems...

Send me:

* The output of `pip list`
* The output of `where flask` or `Get-Command flask` (in PowerShell)
* Your folder structure and which terminal you're using

And Iâ€™ll help you debug it step by step.
